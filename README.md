# markowitz-portfolio-optimization
This repository contains the implementation of Markowitz Portfolio Optimization using Python. The project involves solving quadratic optimization problems for various constraints and scenarios using solvers like Gurobipy or QP solvers. The efficient frontier for different investment strategies is plotted and analyzed.

Project Objectives

1. Portfolio Optimization: Formulate the Markowitz model as a quadratic optimization problem.

2. Scenario Analysis:
Task 1: Minimize portfolio variance while achieving a specific expected return.
Task 2: Allow partial capital investment and compare with Task 1.
Task 3: Modify constraints to achieve at least a minimum expected return.
Task 4: Enable short selling and evaluate the effect on portfolio allocation.

3. Visualization: Generate efficient frontier plots for each task to visualize trade-offs between risk and return.

Key Findings

1. Efficient Frontier:
Task 1 produces a standard efficient frontier.
Task 2 shows a less restrictive frontier with partial investment options.
Task 3 ensures higher returns for specific risk levels.
Task 4 expands possibilities by including short selling.

2. Impact of Constraints:
Each modification alters the portfolio allocation and trade-offs between risk and return.
